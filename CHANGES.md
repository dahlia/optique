Optique changelog
=================

Version 0.4.0
-------------

To be released.

### @optique/core

 -  Extended `merge()` combinator to support up to 10 parsers (previously
    limited to 5), allowing more complex CLI configurations with larger numbers
    of parsers to be combined into a single object structure.

### @optique/temporal

The *@optique/temporal* package was introduced in this release, providing
parsers for JavaScript Temporal types. This package depends on
the *@js-temporal/polyfill* package for environments that do not yet
support Temporal natively.

 -  Added `TimeZone` type.
 -  Added `instant()` value parser.
 -  Added `InstantOptions` interface.
 -  Added `duration()` value parser.
 -  Added `DurationOptions` interface.
 -  added `zonedDateTime()` value parser.
 -  Added `ZonedDateTimeOptions` interface.
 -  Added `plainDate()` value parser.
 -  Added `PlainDateOptions` interface.
 -  Added `plainTime()` value parser.
 -  Added `PlainTimeOptions` interface.
 -  Added `plainDateTime()` value parser.
 -  Added `PlainDateTimeOptions` interface.
 -  Added `plainYearMonth()` value parser.
 -  Added `PlainYearMonthOptions` interface.
 -  Added `plainMonthDay()` value parser.
 -  Added `PlainMonthDayOptions` interface.

 -  Added `TimeZoneOptions` interface.


Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on August 29, 2025.

### @optique/core

 -  Added `flag()` parser for creating required Boolean flags that must be
    explicitly provided. Unlike `option()` which defaults to `false` when
    not present, `flag()` fails parsing when not provided, making it useful
    for dependent options and conditional parsing scenarios.

 -  Extended `or()` combinator to support up to 10 parsers (previously limited
    to 5), enabling more complex command-line interfaces with larger numbers
    of mutually exclusive subcommands or options.

 -  Enhanced `withDefault()` to support union types when the default value
    is a different type from the parser result. The result type is now
    `T | TDefault` instead of requiring the default to match the parser type.
    This enables patterns like conditional CLI structures with dependent
    options where different default structures are needed based on flag states.

 -  Modified `object()` parser to use greedy parsing behavior. The parser now
    attempts to consume all matching fields in a single parse call, rather than
    returning after the first successful field match. This enables dependent
    options patterns where multiple related options need to be parsed together
    (e.g., `--flag --dependent-option`). While this change maintains backward
    compatibility for most use cases, it may affect performance and parsing
    order in complex scenarios.

 -  Enhanced `merge()` combinator type constraints to accept any parser that
    produces object-like values, not just `object()` parsers. This enables
    combining `withDefault()`, `map()`, and other parsers that generate objects
    with `merge()`. The combinator also now properly supports parsers with
    different state management strategies using specialized state handling to
    preserve the expected state format for each parser type.

 -  Modified `Parser.getDocFragments()` method signature to use
    `DocState<TState>` discriminated union instead of direct state values.
    The new signature is `getDocFragments(state: DocState<TState>, ...args)`.
    This change improves type safety by explicitly modeling when parser state
    is available versus unavailable, fixing crashes in help generation when
    using `merge()` with `or()` combinations. This only affects advanced users
    who directly call `getDocFragments()` or implement custom parsers.

     -  Added `DocState` type.
     -  Changed the type of `Parser.getDocFragments()`'s first parameter
        from `TState` to `DocState<TState>`.

 -  Added `longestMatch()` combinator that selects the parser which consumes
    the most input tokens. Unlike `or()` which returns the first successful
    match, `longestMatch()` tries all provided parsers and chooses the one
    with the longest match. This enables context-aware parsing where more
    specific patterns take precedence over general ones, making it ideal for
    implementing sophisticated help systems where `command --help` shows
    command-specific help rather than global help. The combinator supports
    function overloads for 2â€“5 parsers plus a variadic version, with full
    type inference for discriminated union results.

 -  Modified `run()` function in `@optique/core/facade` to use `longestMatch()`
    instead of `or()` for help parsing. This enables context-aware help behavior
    where `subcommand --help` shows help specific to that command instead of
    global help. For example, `myapp list --help` now displays help for
    the `list` command rather than the global application help.
    This change affects all help modes (`"command"`, `"option"`, and
    `"both"`). Applications using the `run()` function will automatically
    benefit from improved help UX without code changes.

 -  Refactored `run()` function help API to group related options together for
    better type safety. The new API prevents invalid combinations and provides
    a cleaner interface:

    ~~~~ typescript
    run(parser, args, {
      help: {
        mode: "both",           // "command" | "option" | "both"
        onShow: process.exit,   // Optional callback
      }
    });
    ~~~~

 -  Added `version` functionality to the `run()` function, supporting both
    `--version` option and `version` command modes:

    ~~~~ typescript
    run(parser, args, {
      version: {
        mode: "option",         // "command" | "option" | "both"
        value: "1.0.0",         // Version string to display
        onShow: process.exit,   // Optional callback
      }
    });
    ~~~~

    The `version` configuration follows the same pattern as `help`, with
    three modes:

     -  `"option"`: Only `--version` flag is available
     -  `"command"`: Only `version` subcommand is available
     -  `"both"`: Both `--version` and `version` subcommand work

### @optique/run

 -  The `run()` function now provides context-aware help behavior,
    automatically inheriting the improvements from `@optique/core/facade`.
    Applications using `@optique/run` will see the same enhanced help system
    where `subcommand --help` shows command-specific help instead of global
    help.

 -  Simplified help API by removing the `"none"` option.
    Since disabling help can be achieved by simply omitting the `help` option,
    the explicit `"none"` value is no longer needed:

    ~~~~ typescript
    // Old API
    run(parser, { help: "none" }); // Explicitly disable help
    run(parser, { help: "both" }); // Enable help

    // New API
    run(parser, {}); // Help disabled (omit the option)
    run(parser, { help: "both" }); // Enable help: "command" | "option" | "both"
    ~~~~

    The help option now only accepts `"command" | "option" | "both"`. To
    disable help functionality, simply omit the `help` option entirely.

 -  Added `version` functionality with a flexible API that supports both
    simple string and detailed object configurations:

    ~~~~ typescript
    // Simple version configuration (uses default "option" mode)
    run(parser, { version: "1.0.0" });

    // Advanced version configuration
    run(parser, {
      version: {
        value: "1.0.0",
        mode: "both"  // "command" | "option" | "both"
      }
    });
    ~~~~

    The version functionality automatically calls `process.exit(0)` when
    version information is requested, making it suitable for CLI applications
    that need to display version and exit.

 -  Added structured message output functions for CLI applications with
    automatic terminal detection and consistent formatting:

     -  Added `print()` function for general output to stdout.
     -  Added `printError()` function for error output to stderr with automatic
        `Error: ` prefix and optional process exit.
     -  Added `createPrinter()` function for custom output scenarios with
        predefined formatting options.
     -  Added `PrintOptions` and `PrintErrorOptions` interfaces for type-safe
        configuration.
     -  Added `Printer` type for custom printer functions.

    All output functions automatically detect terminal capabilities (colors,
    width) and format structured messages consistently across different
    environments.


Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on August 22, 2025.

### @optique/core

 -  Added `concat()` function for concatenating multiple `tuple()` parsers into
    a single flattened tuple, similar to how `merge()` works for `object()`
    parsers. [[#1]]

 -  Fixed an infinite loop issue in the main parsing loop that could occur when
    parsers succeeded but didn't consume input.

 -  Fixed bundled short options (e.g., `-vdf` for `-v -d -f`) not being parsed
    correctly in some cases.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Released on August 21, 2025.

### @optique/core

 -  Fixed a bug where `object()` parsers containing only Boolean flags would
    fail when no arguments were provided, instead of defaulting the flags to
    `false`. [[#6]]
